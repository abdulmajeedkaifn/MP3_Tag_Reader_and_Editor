# MP3_Tag_Reader_and_Editor
Project Overview:
This project is an MP3 Tag Reader and Editor built in C, designed for managing metadata within .mp3 files using the ID3v2 standard. The program enables extraction and modification of key information like the title, artist, album, genre, and more, providing a comprehensive tool for music file organization and customization. By working directly with the ID3 tags, it allows users to access and edit metadata, enhancing both audio library management and usability.

Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a tool for efficiently reading, displaying, and modifying metadata within .mp3 files, giving users control over audio file information. This capability aids in keeping music libraries well-organized, enabling users to personalize and correct metadata for a better playback experience.

Key Features of MP3 Tag Reader and Editor Project:

ID3v2 Tag Compatibility: Works with ID3v2 tags, providing access to the most widely-used metadata format in .mp3 files.
Metadata Display and Editing: Reads, displays, and edits various metadata fields like title, artist, album, genre, and year.
Command-Line Interface: Offers a user-friendly CLI for specifying .mp3 files and the tags to modify or view.
Efficient File Handling: Uses C file I/O for accessing and modifying .mp3 files seamlessly.
Structured Code: Utilizes custom data structures for organized, maintainable code, making it easy to expand functionality if required.
How It Works:
The program reads the .mp3 file, locating and interpreting the ID3v2 tag data to display or update fields as requested. With a clear command structure, users can specify which tags to view or modify, ensuring a streamlined, flexible editing experience.

ID3 Tag Structure and Reading Process:

Tag Reading Process: The program locates the ID3 tag header, then reads and parses individual frames to display metadata.
Tag Editing Process: Users can specify tags to update, allowing the program to modify existing frames or add new ones if needed.
With this tool, users can customize the metadata in their .mp3 files, ensuring their music collections are well-organized and easily searchable, all while maintaining full control over the displayed information in playback applications.
